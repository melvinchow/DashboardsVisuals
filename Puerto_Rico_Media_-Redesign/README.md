# The Media has neglected Puerto Rico during their Hurricane Crisis (Redesign)

It seems that most Americans do not give Puerto Rico the same amount of attention commonly given to other US territories.
In the past several weeks, three hurricanes devastated three parts of the United States. Of those three, Puerto Rico received the least attention.

Here are trend lines showing rises in conversation on TV about each hurricane-affected area over the days before and after the hurricanes made landfall. The spike in TV conversation about Puerto Rico right as the hurricane hit was much smaller than the spike in mentions of Texas and Florida as hurricanes hit each of those states.

## How different cable news channels covered the hurricanes

Various TV News outlets contributed to coverage of the three recent hurricanes and their impact on the United States. Some news outlets reporting on the hurricanes more than others.

BBC News, a British TV network, covered Hurricane Maria (the hurricane that hit Puerto Rico) more than any U.S. network. Within US networks, CNN seems to have covered Hurricane Maria the most.

MSNBC gave Hurricane Maria the least attention.

Why the abysmal lack of coverage? Many speculate that most US Citizens don't recognize Puerto Rico as part of the United States.
