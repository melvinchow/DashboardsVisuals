# MSIS Program Fact Sheet

When searching for and applying to schools and their programs of study, students have many factors and criteria to consider, including:
* School prestige / rankings
* Job titles graduates hold from specific programs
* Geographic environment
* Professor / staff quality
* School population

I have decided to compare Santa Clara University against San Jose State University, because both schools are located close together and old relatively good reputations among other schools nationwide. School / program characteristics I have decided to display to applicants are:
* Ranking, (& what do these rankings mean?)
* Student/faculty ratio
* City crime rates

With such limited space (one page) this fact sheet needs to be understandable to the audience from first glance and minimal thinking required to realize the message. I realized that in the previous attempt of this fact sheet I did not explain the rankings properly, as the rank titles are specific. I could either choose different ranking titles easier to understand, or explain the current titles I've used.
