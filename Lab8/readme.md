When searching for and applying to schools and their programs of study, students have many factors and criteria to consider, including:
* School prestige / rankings
* Job titles graduates hold from specific programs
* Geographic environment
* Professor / staff quality
* School population

Compared to SJSU:

Ranking, (& what do these rankings mean?)
Student/faculty ratio,
City crime rates
