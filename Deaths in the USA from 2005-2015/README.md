# Guns and White People Are Not Special Cases When Considering Other Causes of Death

Reading the original article, the messages I got from the author were that:
* Whites face a much bigger threat of death by guns than blacks do
* Gun deaths happen more frequently than vehicle deaths

Well, I don't see the same problems when arranging the data by year and including other races in the population other than blacks and whites.

There has always been more non-white deaths than white deaths as the years go by. Whether or not guns are involved isn't the problem, and whites are not dying at any faster rate compared to other races.

Vehicle deaths happen much more frequently than gun deaths, and the death rates of each have remained the same. Maybe vehicle laws or traffic law enforcement practices need revamping more than gun laws do.

I wanted to hide the years earlier than 2010, because more whites than non-whites died in those years. If my opposition saw that, they would argue that there is a history of whites have facing more danger than non-whites, so if it has been a problem before, it could be a problem again.

I hid the data from 2009 and earlier years, because those years show a sudden drop in the number of vehicle deaths. If seen by my opposition, they can argue that if vehicle deaths are dropping while gun deaths stay the same, then in the future gun deaths will be a bigger problem than vehicle deaths.
