# Dashboard about SCU MSIS Program for Recruiters

Recruiters would be interested in knowing how Santa Clara University compares to other colleges that have a business school, so a school ranking chart is included. SCU is highlighted in dark blue.

Recruiters would love to learn if the SCU MSIS program teaches most of the top skills on LinkedIn each year. Recruiters can find the specific skills they are looking for in candidates on the dashboard, then see if the SCU MSIS program teaches it. Color codes are given to show which of those skills the MSIS program do and do not teach.

Of all MSIS program alumni, there are skills they graduate with, and other skills they are less likely to have after graduating. Given a candidate from SCU MSIS Program taken at random, and what skills a recruiter is looking for, the recruiter will be confident in the candidate if the recruiter is looking for a skill that is very common among SCU alumni graduating that year.


## Redesign Goals

My original dashboard had virtually zero interactivity. This time I wanted to fit more information into the dashboard by using a viewer-selectable filter to see changes over time and to display only the information a specific viewer will find relevant. Not all SCU MSIS alumni graduate in the same year, so I have included more top Linkedin Skill rankings, separated by year, so that a recruiter can match an applicant's graduating year with the number of top skills the SCU MSIS program taught during that year.

Viewers will also be able to see the changing demand of various professional skillsets. A skill relevant in one year can be less relevant the next year, or vice versa. Yet another factor a recruiter should take into account when looking for candidates. One skill a candidate has can be irrelevant now, but can possibly be valuable the next year.
