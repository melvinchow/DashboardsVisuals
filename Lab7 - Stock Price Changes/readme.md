In the previous attempt, my data only contained year of data breach, and nothing more specific. This time I decided to find another dataset that contained exact dates the companies announced they have been breached, so I can track stock price changes immediately following announcement. Close values of each stock price trading day are used. Price change (in Dollars) is measured from the day a company announces the breach, to 3 days after the announcement.

I visualized rise and drop in stock prices with line slopes. One can easily see that the lines tend to have negative slopes than positive.

Stock prices can both rise and fall after a data breach announcement, but more likely they will drop slightly. This visual does not take into account that stock changes can be affected by a variety of factors, not just data breaches, one can easily refute the original claim that financial markets punish security breaches.

I understand that 13 companies, all in different industries with different dates of breach, are probably not representative of all industries and years overall. I took this dataset simply because I wanted to see immediate price changes following data breach announcements.
